## How to start the game
1. Download and dezip the zork.zip file in the Releases section
2. Run zork.exe

## How to play
### The game is based on text commands. As a tip, always try to type simple commands that might seem like "broken" English. The program will have a better time understanding it!
1. You will get some information about your whereabouts
2. Then, you will decide what to do. Use commands like:
   - `go north` or `go bathroom` for example, to go to other locations
   - `explore` to see the information about the room you're currently in. Use this everywhere you can, as it will tell you extra information!
   - `take key` or `get key` to take an item in the current room and add it to your inventory
   - `use key on school` or `use key on south` to use an item on a location or even on another item (this requires the indirect object to be followed by "on"!)
   - `look key` or `look at office` to see some information about things around you
   - `drop item` to drop an item in your inventory. This will leave it at your location
3. Your objective is to find the property scripture of a school you inherited from your father. However, he died in mysterious circumstances and didn't leave many clues...

## How to win
- Travel to different locations using `go`.
- Use `take` to take some objects (you will NEED some to progress!).
- Use `look` to get information about things.
- You might find some locked doors, so think about how to get past them!.
- Your final objective is to find a scripture. It most likely will be hidden somewhere...
